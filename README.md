# Util-O-Rama version 4.0.x Alpha Release
Util-O-Rama Utilities for Light-O-Rama Version 4 and xLights version 2021.xx
Copyright Â© 2021+ by Doctor ðŸ§™ Wizard and Wâš¡zlights Software

This is a FREEWARE set of utilities for the animated holiday light community, mainly
users of Light-O-Rama Showtime version S4 and xLights.  These utilities provide
file manipulating functionality not included in the core applications.
Utilities include:
Vamp-O-Rama aka Vamperizer: This utility uses the Queen Mary and other Vamp plugins
and Sonic Annotator to create timing marks and channels with song analytics for
Showtime and xLights.  This varies from the Vamp plugin functions built into
xLights by doing a bunch of post-processing on the Vamp output to make the data
cleaner and more useful to a sequencer.  Also, Showtime doesn't include that
functionality.
Map-O-Rama: This utilty allows you to map the channels from one (possibly old)
sequence to another (possibly new) sequence where channels have been moved,
renamed, or added/deleted and copy all the data from one to the other.
Split-O-Rama: Allows the user to split a sequence file into smaller ones copying
only the desired tracks and channels.
Merge-O-Rama: The compliment to Split-O-Rama.  Merges sequences.
Info-Rama: Generates a report about a sequence.
RGB-O-Rama: Allows the user to do global search-replace functions of colors used
in RGB Channels.
Sparkle-O-Rama: Creates random sparkly effects with many tunable parameters.
Time-O-Rama: Converts back and forth between Showtime and xLights timing tracks
and channels with import and export functions not included in the native apps.
Compare-O-Rama: Compares the channel names and output numbers between Showtime
sequences, LOR Visualizer, and xLights layouts and reports the differences.
