<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    <i><b>Util-O-Rama</b></i> is a suite of utilities written to manipulate sequence files for <i>Light-O-Rama Showtime</i> version 4.x and <i>xLights</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    <i>Util-O-Rama</i> is Charity-Ware. Most of the utilities and features will work for free for anyone. However by making a donation of $25 or more to the xLights development team, or to any animal-related charity, I will provide you with a registration code to enable extra features. Animal charities may be for pets or wild animals and also includes nature reserves. Examples include ASPCA, Humane Society, your local animal shelter, Save the Whales, Audubon society, and the Nature Conservancy. Sorry, human related charities do not count. Send me a copy of the receipt with any sensitive details blacked out and I will send you a registration code. Do not block out your name, the date, the amount, or the name of the charity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    <i><b>Util-O-Rama</b></i> consists of the following programs:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    <font color="#2a6099"><u><b>Split-O-Rama</b></u></font>: Allows you to split a Light-O-Rama Showtime S4 sequence. It creates a new sequence from your source sequence containing only the channels you specify. You can save the list of specified channels so that you may split multiple source sequences the same way.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    <font color="#ff8000"><u><b>Merge-O-Rama</b></u></font>: Allows you to merge some or all channels from 2 different source sequences into a new sequence. Again, it allows you to save the list of selected channels.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    <font color="#00a933"><u><b>Map-O-Rama</b></u></font>: So say you add a couple channels, or rename some, or re-arrange them in the tracks. The original intended use of Map-O-Rama allows you to remap old sequences and copy all effects to your new layout. This includes remapping the channels from a shared or downloaded sequence which may have a vastly different layout. But it’s pretty versatile about remapping channels so you may find other uses.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    <font color="#800080"><u><b>Vamp-O-Rama</b></u></font> (aka Vamperizer): Uses the Vamp plugins to create effects and timing tracks for both Light-O-Rama and xLights sequences. The Vamp-O-Rama program performs a lot of post processing on the output from the Vamp plugins to label, scale, and align the exact times and values.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    <font color="#acb20c"><u><b>Channel-O-Rama</b></u></font>: A database for your AC and DC controller channels. Not really meant for pixels but can be used for them too.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    <font color="#ff0000"><u><b>Compare-O-Rama</b></u></font>: Compares channel names and output addresses between the Channel-O-Rama database, a Light-O-Rama sequence and Visualizer file and your xLights layout, reporting any discrepancies or mismatches.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    <font color="#5983b0"><u><b>Dim-O-Rama</b></u></font>: Allows you to scale the brightness of selected channels in your LOR sequence, make sure they are either fully on or off (no dimming), or to make sure they stay on or off for a minimum amount of time. Useful for non-conventional lights, projectors, and motorized channels.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    <font color="#a7074b"><u><b>Flip-O-Rama</b></u></font>: Similar in function to <i>Bob O’s clipboard flipper</i>. Used to ‘flip’ or reverse a bunch of channels in a clipboard file by order and/or time. But will flip either clipboard files or selected channels in a sequence. Unlike Bob O’s, it can flip non-contiguous channels.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    <font color="#5eb91e"><u><b>RGB-O-Rama</b></u></font>: Global search-and-replace function for RGB colors.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    <font color="#a1467e"><u><b>Sparkle-O-Rama</b></u></font>: Generates random fades and sparkle effects for selected groups of AC, DC, and RGB channels.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    <font color="#ea7500"><u><b>Time-O-Rama</b></u></font>: Converts Showtime timing grids and/or channels into xLights timing tracks and vise-versa.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    <font color="#355269"><u><b>InfO-Rama</b></u></font>: compiles reports, checks for errors, and generates statistics about Showtime sequences.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    <font color="#00a933"><u><b>Launch-O-Rama</b></u></font>: Just a convenient launchpad for the various Util-O-Rama programs- for now.&nbsp; This may get some very simple macro-like or automation abilities to perform a series of operations on a batch of sequences using one Util-O-Rama program, and/or perform a series of operations on a single sequence using multiple Util-O-Rama programs.&nbsp; (Suggestions welcome.)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    <font color="#ff6d6d"><u><b>Sort-O-Rama</b></u></font> and <font color="#ff6d6d"><u><b>xSort</b></u></font>: [Future, planned] Sorts the channels in your Showtime and xLights sequences by name or channel number. It only does this within the file’s raw channel data and does NOT affect the order they display in when using Showtime or xLights. (It does not modify track, group, or layout orders) This is intended to help people who manually edit or search the XML in their sequence files.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    <font color="#50938a"><u><b>Group-O-Rama</b></u></font>: [Future, planned] automatically creates channel groups based on certain criteria. Example, grouping channels by controller and output number, or by color, or by keywords in their name.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    <u><b>Util-O-Rama</b></u> supports Light-O-Rama Showtime version 4.x. It does NOT support versions 5.x and higher. The version 5 file format is drastically different, not everything in the files is obvious what it is for, and none of it is documented. I have asked Light-O-Rama several times for information about the version 5 file format and even offered to sign a non-disclosure agreement and they have not replied and completely ignored me. So for now at least, support for version 5 and higher is not planned unless and until I can get proper documentation about the file format.</p>
