Scenario 1:  You just downloaded a bunch of cool sequences from some guy.  But his channel layout is nothing like yours.  If you just apply your channel template to his
sequence nothing will make any sense.  Or you can spend hours in the Sequence Editor, rearranging his channels, copying and pasting channels, etc.
Or you can use my Channel Remapper!
Load your channel template or one of your existing sequences on the right side.
Load the new sequence on the left side.
Choose a channel from the old sequence, and one from your template, and click "Map".
You can map as few or as many channels as you wish.  You can map more than one channel in the new sequence to one of the channels in your template.
Then click "Remap" and it will generate a new sequence for you with your channel template, but the animations will be copied from the source sequence channels to your
channels in the way you chose.
If you got more than one sequence from the same source, you can save your remappings to a file and reapply them the other sequences as well.

Scenario 2:  You made a lot of changes to your layout this year, and rearranged some channels into a new order.  You can't just import your new channel template into
last years sequences because the order is different and new stuff has been inserted.  Maybe some channels have been deleted.
Use my Channel Remapper!
Load your new channel template for this year on the right side.
Load your old sequence from last year on the left side.
Click on an old channel on the left, click on the corresponding new channel on the right, and click "Map".
Do this until all your channels are remapped.
Click the "Remap" button the generate a new sequence with last years animations copied into this years channel template.
Now save the mapping file.  You can reapply this mapping to all of last years sequences.
