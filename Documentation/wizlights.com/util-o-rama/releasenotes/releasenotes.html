<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    <b>All Utilities</b>: Support for Cosmic Color Ribbons and devices other than AC/DC and DMX is spotty. No support for input pups or sub-sequences. Support for loops and animations is spotty.&nbsp; If you actually use any of these things in Showtime, please test them in Util-O-Rama and report back to me where they break.&nbsp; Please include a sample sequence.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
&nbsp;Several utilities such as Map and Merge have a fuzzy matching skill for channel names. Ability to turn it on or off, and to review and correct its matches is spotty.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    Because of the possibility of corrupting an important sequence, none of the Util-O-Rama programs will currently allow you to overwrite an existing file.&nbsp; Trust me, you don&#39;t want to.&nbsp; Keep lots of backups!&nbsp; I highly recommend using GitHub for your sequences.&nbsp; Since sequences are basically XML files, GitHub will allow you to review ALL changes that have been made and undo any specific ones you wish or to roll back to a version from a previous date.&nbsp; Overwriting files in Util-O-Rama will eventually be allowed once it is deemed reliable.</p>

    <font color="#800080"><u><b>Vamp-O-Rama</b></u></font>: This is a hugely complicated program which still has a lot of issues but is still totally usable. Not all Vamp plugins work correctly, some may not work at all. I think all the Queen Mary ones do, as well as several third party ones. Some features are incomplete. It often has issues with the step size setting and it is supposed to automatically detect and correct for that. It does not do so consistently and you may need to manually specify the step size based on error messages in the output window. There is an option for outputting the note names in Unicode which actually works except that both Showtime and xLights have trouble digesting it. So don’t use that option.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    When submitting bug reports, depending on the bug, it may be useful to include some of the temporary files generated as related to the bug. They can be found in <font face="DejaVu Sans Mono, monospace"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><a href="file:///C:/Users/YourName/AppData/Local/Temp/UtilORama/VampORama">C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Temp\UtilORama\VampORama</a>&nbsp; </font></font>There is a button in the upper-right section of Vamp-O-Rama to open this folder in file explorer for you.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    Split-O-Rama: Working OK to the best of my knowledge, other than issues listed above under “All Utilities”.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    Merge-O-Rama: Working OK to the best of my knowledge other than issues listed above under “All Utilities”. This includes the above issues with fuzzy name matching.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    Map-O-Rama: Mostly usable but sometimes does not recognize and/or duplicates beat tracks. Map and Unmap buttons do not always enable/disable themselves at appropriate times. Does not correctly highlight mapped channels under certain situations. Has issues listed above under “All Utilities” including issues with fuzzy name matching.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    Channel-O-Rama: Think this is working OK but note that it only lists DMX universes and not LOR unit numbers (but you can still use it for LOR unit numbers). Needs an option to change the labeling accordingly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    Compare-O-Rama: Does not distinguish between actual channels, and groups – intentionally. But this can cause it to misreport matches and mismatches. Still looking for a work-around.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    Dim-O-Rama: Still under development. Does not work at all, yet.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    RGB-O-Rama: Broken due other changes in the code. Does not work at all currently. Will be fixed soon.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    Sparkle-O-Rama: Broken due other changes in the code. Does not work at all currently. Once the code changes get fixed, many of the options are not finished and currently do nothing or have no effect. Many more cool tricks and ways to generate and control effects are planned.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    Flip-O-Rama: Still under development.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    InfO-Rama: Information is incomplete and occasionally inaccurate. Still looking for suggestions on what issues to test for and what information to report on. Mostly it is now checking for known issues caused by known bugs in the Util-O-Rama programs.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    Time-O-Rama: Working I think. More controls and options are planned. Exports and imports only from xLights timing files (imported or exported from xLights) and does not directly write to or modify xLights sequences, yet. Converts xLights timing files into a file which must be manually edited into a Showtime sequence using Notepad (or better yet, Notepad++). Pay attention to the SaveID field of the timing grids! They will need to be manually adjusted. Plans are for Time-O-Rama to do this automatically.</p>
