    <i>Util-O-Rama</i> is also <strong>Charity-Ware</strong>. Most of the utilities and features will work for free for anyone. However by making a donation of $25 or more to the xLights development team, or to any animal-related charity, I will provide you with a registration code to enable extra features. Charities may be for pets or wild animals and also includes nature reserves. Examples include ASPCA, Humane Society, your local animal shelter, Terrier Rescue, Save the Whales, Audubon society, and the Nature Conservancy. Sorry, human related charities do not count. Send me a copy of the receipt with any sensitive details blacked out and I will send you a registration code. Do not block out your name, the date, the amount, or the name of the charity.&nbsp; Qualified beta testers may use all the programs and features without making a charitable contribution (but you still can if you wish).</p>
