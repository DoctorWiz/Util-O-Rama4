    <strong>Installation</strong></p>
<p>
    Util-O-Rama is distributed as a portable zip file.&nbsp; In case you don&#39;t know what &#39;portable&#39; means, it means you can extract the zip file to any folder you want, wherever is convenient for you, and run it from there.&nbsp; Util-O-Rama does NOT include an installer at this time although that is planned for later.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">
    Prerequisites:</p>
<p>
    Util-O-Rama uses the newest Microsoft .Net version 6.&nbsp; Because this is fairly new, there is a good chance you do not already have it installed.&nbsp; If you do, it may need updating.&nbsp; Go <a href="https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/2e97f1f0-f321-4baf-8d02-0be5f08afc4e/2a011c8f9b2792e17d363a21c0ed8fdc/dotnet-runtime-6.0.4-win-x64.exe">here</a> and download the Microsoft .Net version 6 runtime and install it.</p>
<p>
    If you wish to use the Vamp-O-Rama or Vamperizer application you will also need to download and install the 64-bit version of the Vamp Plugins (preferably ALL of them, but at a minimum you will need all the Queen Mary ones) which you can get <a href="https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/attachments/download/2698/Vamp%20Plugin%20Pack%20Installer%201.0.exe">here</a>, and the 64-bit version of Sonic Annotator which you can get <a href="https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/attachments/download/2709/sonic-annotator-1.6-win64.zip">here</a>.</p>
<p>
    Download the Util-O-Rama zip file <a href="http://wizlights.com/utilorama/download/utilorama.zip">here</a>.</p>
<p>
    Using Windows File Explorer Make a new folder named Util-O-Rama somewhere on your computer.&nbsp; Suggested locations would be in C:\Program Files or C:/PortableApps or in your Christmas directory.&nbsp; You can even put it right on your desktop if you want (although I don&#39;t particularly recommend that).&nbsp; Once you create the new folder, open it, and leave it open in File Explorer</p>
<p>
    Open the downloaded zip file and copy the contents to the new folder.&nbsp; The easiest way is to select all the file in the zip window and drag-drop them to the new folder you have open in File Explorer.</p>
<p>
    The Util-O-Rama programs are in beta state.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t understand the above directions, you probably have no business trying to run beta software.&nbsp; Please wait until the software is a bit more mature and has an installer.</p>
